It is the administrative headquarters of the Mohali district. It is also one of the six Municipal Corporations of the State. It was officially named after Sahibzada Ajit Singh, the eldest son of Guru Gobind Singh. It is still known and popular as "Mohali" among local people and other parts of India.[3]

Mohali has emerged as one of the most important cities in Punjab and the rest of northern India; it is developing rapidly as an IT hub of the state. Special emphasis has been made by the state government to make this city the best place to live in Punjab. The city also has many international sporting venues consisting of a cricket stadium, hockey stadium, indoor stadiums, and a golf course. Mohali has an International Airport as well.[4]

Mohali, along with Chandigarh and Panchkula, forms a part of the Chandigarh Tricity. It was earlier a part of the Rupnagar District and was carved out and made a part of a separate district in 2006.
